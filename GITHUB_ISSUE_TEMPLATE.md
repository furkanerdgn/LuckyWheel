# [FEATURE REQUEST] Missing Core Functions Implementation

## Issue Summary
The LuckyWheel project is currently missing several critical functions that prevent it from being fully functional. This issue tracks the implementation of missing features to make the application complete.

## üö® Critical Priority (Blocks Core Functionality)

### 1. Wheel Spinning Animation
- [ ] Implement `spinWheel()` function in `src/components/Wheel.jsx`
- [ ] Add rotation animation using D3.js or CSS transforms
- [ ] Calculate random rotation degrees for realistic spinning
- [ ] Handle spin completion and stopping

### 2. Winner Selection Logic
- [ ] Implement `selectWinner()` function based on wheel position
- [ ] Calculate winner index from final rotation angle
- [ ] Handle winner announcement

### 3. Spin Button Functionality
- [ ] Add `onClick` handler to spin button
- [ ] Connect button to spinning logic
- [ ] Handle button state during spinning (disabled/enabled)

## üî• High Priority

### 4. Data Persistence
- [ ] Implement localStorage for activities
- [ ] Add `saveActivitiesToStorage()` function
- [ ] Add `loadActivitiesFromStorage()` function
- [ ] Auto-save on activity changes

### 5. Edit Activity Feature
- [ ] Add edit mode toggle for activities
- [ ] Implement `editActivity()` function
- [ ] Create edit form UI
- [ ] Handle activity updates

### 6. Enhanced Validation
- [ ] Prevent duplicate activities
- [ ] Add activity name length validation
- [ ] Implement input sanitization

## üìã Medium Priority

### 7. Winner Display Modal
- [ ] Create `WinnerModal.jsx` component
- [ ] Add celebration animation
- [ ] Implement modal open/close logic

### 8. Activity History
- [ ] Track spin results
- [ ] Display winner history
- [ ] Add history clearing functionality

### 9. Sound Effects
- [ ] Add spinning sound effect
- [ ] Add winner announcement sound
- [ ] Add button click sounds

## üí° Low Priority (Future Enhancements)

### 10. Export/Import Activities
- [ ] Export activities to JSON
- [ ] Import activities from JSON
- [ ] Share activity lists

### 11. Activity Categories
- [ ] Group activities by categories
- [ ] Add category filtering
- [ ] Color-code by category

### 12. Statistics Dashboard
- [ ] Track spin frequency
- [ ] Show most selected activities
- [ ] Display usage analytics

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### 13. Responsive Design Issues
- [ ] Fix button positioning on mobile (`marginX="22rem"`)
- [ ] Improve text truncation in activity cards
- [ ] Optimize wheel sizing for different screens

## Technical Requirements

### Files to Create:
- `src/components/WinnerModal.jsx`
- `src/components/SpinControls.jsx`
- `src/components/ActivityHistory.jsx`
- `src/utils/wheelAnimation.js`
- `src/utils/soundEffects.js`
- `src/utils/storage.js`

### Dependencies to Consider:
- Animation library (or continue with D3.js)
- Audio library for sound effects
- localStorage utilities

## Definition of Done

### For Critical Priority:
- [ ] User can click "Spin the Wheel" button
- [ ] Wheel animates with realistic spinning motion
- [ ] Winner is selected and announced
- [ ] Application is fully functional for basic use case

### For High Priority:
- [ ] Activities persist after page refresh
- [ ] Users can edit existing activities
- [ ] Input validation prevents errors

### For Medium Priority:
- [ ] Winner is displayed in a modal with celebration
- [ ] History of winners is tracked and displayed
- [ ] Sound effects enhance user experience

## Time Estimate
- **Critical**: 2-3 days
- **High Priority**: 2-3 days
- **Medium Priority**: 3-4 days
- **Low Priority**: 5-7 days

**Total**: 12-17 days for complete implementation

## Notes
- Priority should be given to Critical and High Priority items
- Each item can be broken into separate pull requests
- Consider creating separate issues for each major feature group
- Testing should be implemented alongside each feature
